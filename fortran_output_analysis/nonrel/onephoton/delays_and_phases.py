                     matching.
                     Possible options:
                     "interp_both" - interpolate both absorption and emission paths for the final
                                     energies.
                     "lin_extrap_emi" - linearly extrapolate the emission path and interpolate the
                                        absorption path for the final energies.
                     "lin_extrap_emi_left" - linearly extrapolate the emission path to the left using
                                             the first two points and interpolate the absosrption
                                             path for the final energies.
        unwrap - tells if the phase should be unwrapped.

    Returns:
        ekin_final_eV - an array of electron kinetic energies in eV.
        wigner_delay_ang_part - angular part of the Wigner delay at the specified angles.
